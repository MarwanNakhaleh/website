									<h1>My Interests</h1>
									<p>I know software engineers usually talk mostly about software on their websites, but I want to make this not just about myself with respect to my career, but about my other interests too. I'm a complete person and I want the world to know that.</p>

									<h2>Family</h2>
									<p>My family and I may get on each other's nerves, but we really were made for each other. Part of my job is to take care of them and ensure they're happy, healthy, and safe.</p>

									<h2>Relationship</h2>
									<p>Amber is part of the proof that I see that God wants me to be happy. We enjoy each other's company and despite having very different backgrounds, we have a lot in common.</p>

									<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>At heart, I just wanna help others and help myself. It sounds very ordinary, but it is precisely <i>because</i> is is so ordinary that helping others is integral to life as a human being. Ignore the ratchet podium setup.</p>

									<h2>Software</h2>
									<p>Software exists to solve people's problems. I use it as a tool to solve problems and improve my life and that of other people. Contrary to popular belief, I don't spend hours and hours delving into the intricacies of software technologies just for fun. I just wanna use the power of technology to improve the world</p>

									<h2>Cars</h2>
									<p>I'm not really a normal car enthusiast. My interest in cars is primarily meeting my automotive objectives as inexpensively as possible, which I do enjoy. My "automotive objectives" right now are primarily focused on having a comfy, luxurious, reliable ride with few issues as cheap as possible.</p>

									<h2>Food</h2>
									<p>I like eating at different places and traveling for amazing food. My favorite foods include mac and cheese, sushi, and fried chicken.</p>

									<h2>Traveling</h2>
									<p>I love road trips. I'm not big into sightseeing, but I have family and close friends scattered around the eastern half of the United States (and some scattered elsewhere) that I like to visit whenever I can.</p>
